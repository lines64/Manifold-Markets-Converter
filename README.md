A simple open-source browser extension to change the % into odds on [Manifold.markets](https://manifold.markets?referrer=prezlus). Convert percentages into decimal, US, fractional, Hong Kong, Indonesian or Malaysian odds. Developed with the purpose of making it easier to spot arbitrage opportunities on "multiple choice" markets.

Still in early beta. You need a free Manifold.markets API to make this work. Currently works on multiple choice markets with more than two answers _(answers must be dependent)_. It is perfect if you want to try and find arbitrage opportunities or value bets in 1x2 or outright markets.
